     This is a GPL'd library for reading and playing SWF (Flash)
     movies by Oliver Debon (http://www.swift-tools.net/Flash/). 

     It is currently output-only.

     The Boundary Devices patches :
     - provide a simple Frame-Buffer player example (video only)
     - add support for audio handling by the application
     - fix some issues with RGB 565, and
     - perform octree conversion to 256 colors (Oliver's code requires
       that everything be palettized)
