     TinyLogin is a suite of tiny Unix utilities for handling logging into,
     being authenticated by, changing one's password for, and otherwise
     maintaining users and groups on an embedded system. It also provides
     shadow password support to enhance system security. TinyLogin is, as the
     name implies, very small, and makes an excellent complement to BusyBox
     on an embedded System. It can be used without BusyBox, of course, but I
     envision them being used together most of the time.
     
     See http://tinylogin.busybox.net/ for details.
